          <p>
            You've been meaning to escape this job for years. Between the
            nepotism, office politics, and budget cuts, there's no hope for
            making it past Assistant to the Regional Manager. You've been eyeing
            web dev for quite some time, and are ready to take the plunge.
            You're going to learn to code.
          </p>
          <p>
            The internet told you not to reinvent the wheel; almost every
            problem on the web has been solved by a framework. Django sounds
            easy, so you ask Reddit to confirm that you're making the right
            choice before you begin your journey.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"Python doesn't scale!"</p>
            <p>"MVC frameworks are dead."</p>
            <p>"Django?? Recruiters will wonder if you can even code!"</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            You remove Django from your computer and wash your hands. Reddit
            saved you from making the mistake of a lifetime; what a relief! 
            Back at square one, you browse through your bookmarks and find that meme 
            you liked about real wizards using PHP. That sounds like a plan, so you 
            take to Reddit again, this time to discuss some <i>real</i> web technology.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>"PHP is a fractal of bad design!"</p>
            <p>"My old boss made me write PHP once; I needed months of therapy after quitting that job."</p>
            <p>"PHP?? But SvelteKit has a docker image now!"</p>
