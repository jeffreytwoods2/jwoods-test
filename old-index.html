            1969 Dodge D100
          </h3>
          <p class="desc-para">
            The day I inherited this truck, I drove it 500 miles from California
            to Utah. That was a brilliant move that seized the engine in the
            middle of the desert. I spent the rest of my checking account having
            it towed home, and then I began saving and rebuilding the truck to
            be my daily driver one day. After 10 long months of waiting, my new
            engine arrived, so I installed it, broke it in, and then after 30
            minutes of driving, it seized. I was out of funds at that point, so
            I sold the rig, gave my wife back her money, and decided to try
            again when I had full-time employment.

            Toy Story Spanish Curiosity
          </h3>
          <p class="desc-para">
            I was 16 years old when Toy Story 3 came out in 2010. I loved it, 
            especially when Buzz Lightyear went into Spanish mode. A couple years later I 
            learned Spanish as a missionary for my church, and one day I remembered the 
            Spanish Buzz scenes. I rewatched the movie and enjoyed the scenes anew, but 
            then I got curious about what Spanish Buzz spoke in the Spanish translations 
            of the film, so I looked into it and made a little video on the topic. 
            Turns out he just speaks Spanish. My little YouTube video exploded 
            in views once Toy Story 4 was announced for some reason. I haven't had a video 
            go viral since.
